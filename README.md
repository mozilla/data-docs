This document is intended to help Mozilla's developers and data scientists
analyze and interpret the data gathered by the Firefox Telemetry system.

At [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org), our data-gathering and data-handling
practices are anchored in our
[Data Privacy Principles](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/principles/)
and elaborated in the [Mozilla Privacy Policy](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/).

To learn more about what data Firefox collects and the choices you can make
as a user, please see the [Firefox Privacy Notice](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/firefox/).

The rendered documentation is hosted at [https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/](https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/).

This documentation is rendered with [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook).
