# Firefox Data Documentation

This document is intended to help Mozilla's developers and data scientists analyze and interpret the data gathered 
by the Firefox Telemetry system.

At [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org), our data-gathering and data-handling practices are anchored in our
[Data Privacy Principles](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/principles/) and elaborated in the
[Mozilla Privacy Policy](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/).

To learn more about what data Firefox collects and the choices you can make as a user, please see the
[Firefox Privacy Notice](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/firefox/). 

You can find the [rendered documentation here](https://mozilla.github.io/firefox-data-docs/).

This documentation is rendered with [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook).
