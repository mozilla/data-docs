# Getting Started

This document is meant to be a complete guide to using Firefox Data,
so it can look overwhelming at first.
These readings will **get you up and running quickly**
After these readings you should be able to produce simple analyses
but you should definitely get your analyses reviewed.

This is a six part section meant to introduce new analysts to our data.
I consider a "new analyst" to be an employee
who is interested in working with our data
but doesn't have previous experience with our tools/data.
They could be technical or non-technical: engineer, PM, or data scientist.

_Getting Started_ covers:

* [Analysis Quick Start](analysis_intro.md) - an introduction to TMO and histograms
* [Data Privacy @ Mozilla](/concepts/data_privacy.md) - what can['t] you share? what can['t] you collect?
* [Choosing a Dataset](/concepts/choosing_a_dataset.md) - where should you look?
* [Intro to STMO](/tools/stmo.md)
* [Common Analysis Gotchas](/concepts/analysis_gotchas.md)
* [Getting Review](/concepts/review.md)
