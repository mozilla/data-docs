datasets provided by the data pipeline\nteam.  After reading this document, you should have a good idea of what dataset\nis the most useful for your analysis.\nBefore making final decisions from your findings, consider getting your query\nor analysis reviewed by a member of the data pipeline team.\nAccessing a dataset\nPlaying with the data is the best way to get comfortable.  All of these\ndatasets can be queried from STMO (AKA:\nre:dash).  STMO will give you an interactive SQL interface, which should be\nsufficient for getting comfortable with the data.  If you need to complete more\ncomplicated analyses or want to productionize your code, see Analyzing\nTelemetry Data.\nOverview\nUnless noted otherwise, these datasets summarize the \"main\" Telemetry ping\ntype.\nThe main ping payload contains most of the measurements used to track\nperformance and health of Firefox in the wild.  It can be useful to refer back\nto the source ping documentation to understand how the source data was\ngenerated.\nDatasets\nTable of Contents\n\nmain_summary\nlongitudinal\ncross_sectional\nclient_count\ncrash_aggregates\n\nMain Summary\nThe main_summary table is the most direct representation of a main ping but\ncan be difficult to work with due to its size. \nRows and Columns\nThe main_summary table contains one row for each ping.  Each column\nrepresents one field from the main ping payload, though only a subset of all\nmain ping fields are included.\nBackground and Caveats\nThis table is massive, and due to it's size, it can be difficult to work with.\nYou should avoid querying main_summary from\nre:dash.  Your queries will be slow to\ncomplete and can impact performance for other users, since re:dash on a\nshared cluster.\nInstead, we recommend using the longitudinal or cross_sectional dataset\nwhere possible.  If these datasets do not suffice, consider using Spark on an\nATMO cluster.  In the odd case where these\nqueries are necessary, make use of the sample_id field and limit to a short\nsubmission date range.\nLongitudinal\nThe longitudinal dataset is a 1% sample of main ping data organized to\nroughly represent a user. If you're not sure which dataset to use for your\nanalysis, this is probably what you want.\nRows and Columns\nEach row in the longitudinal dataset represents one client_id, which is a\nrough approximation of a user.  Each column represents a field from the main\nping.  Most fields contain arrays of values, with one value for each ping\nassociated with a client_id. Using arrays give you access to the raw data from\neach ping, but can be difficult to work with from SQL.  Take a look at the\nlongitudinal examples if you get stuck.\nBackground and Caveats\nThink of the longitudinal table as wide and short.  The dataset contains more\ncolumns than main_summary and down-samples to 1% of all clients to reduce\nquery computation time and save resources.\nIn summary, the longitudinal table differs from main_summary in two important\nways:\n\nThe longitudinal dataset groups all data so that one row represents a client_id\nThe longitudinal dataset samples to 1% of all client_ids\n\nCross Sectional\nThe cross_sectional dataset provides descriptive statistics for each\nclient_id in a 1% sample of main ping data. This dataset simplifies the\nlongitudinal table by replacing the longitudinal arrays with summary\nstatistics. This is the most useful dataset for describing our user base.\nRows and Columns\nEach row in the cross_sectional dataset represents one client_id, which is\na rough approximation to a user.  Each column is a summary statistic describing\nthe client_id.\nFor example, the longitudinal table has a row called geo_country which\ncontains an array of country codes. For the same client_id the\ncross_sectional table has columns called geo_country_mode and\ngeo_country_configs containing single summary statistics for the modal country and the\nnumber of distinct countries in the array.\n\n\n\nclient_id\ngeo_country\ngeo_country_mode\ngeo_country_configs\n\n\n\n\n1\narray\n\"US\"\n1\n\n\n2\narray\n\"DE\"\n2\n\n\n\nBackground and Caveats\nThis table is much easier to work with than the longitudinal dataset because\nyou don't need to work with arrays.  Note that this dataset is a summary of the\nlongitudinal dataset, so it is also a 1% sample of all client_ids. \nClient Count\nThe client_count dataset is simply a count of clients in a time period,\nstratified over a set of dimensions.\nRows and Columns\nThis dataset includes columns for a dozen factors and an HLL variable.  The\nhll column contains a\nHyperLogLog variable, which is an\napproximation to the exact count.  The factor columns include activity date and\nthe dimensions listed\nhere.\nEach row represents one combinations of the factor columns.\nBackground and Caveats\nIt's important to understand that the hll column is not a standard count.\nThe hll variable avoids double-counting users when aggregating over\nmultiple days.  The HyperLogLog variable is a far more efficient way to count\ndistinct elements of a set, but comes with some complexity.  To find the\ncardinality of an HLL use cardinality(cast(hll AS HLL)).  To find the union\nof two HLL's over different dates, use merge(cast(hll AS HLL)).  The Firefox\nER Reporting Query is\na good example to review.  Finally, Roberto has a relevant writeup\nhere.\nCrash Aggregates\nThe Crash Aggregates dataset compiles crash statistics over various dimensions for each day.\nRows and Columns\nThere's one column for each of the stratifying dimensions and the crash\nstatistics.  Each row is a distinct set of dimensions, along with their\nassociated crash stats.  Example stratifying dimensions include channel and\ncountry, example statistics include usage hours and plugin crashes. See the\ncomplete documentation for all available dimensions\nand statistics.\nAppendix\nMobile Metrics\nThere are several tables owned by the mobile team documented\nhere: \n\nandroid_events\nandroid_clients\nandroid_addons\nmobile_clients\n\nWiki For reference, a previous version of this document was stored\nhere.\nWho to Contact\nFeel free to open an issue or contact Ryan Harter\n(@harterrt) to identify errors or confusing\nparts of this documentation.
