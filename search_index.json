Datasets\nlongitudinal\nmain_summary\ncross_sectional\nclient_count\n\n\nCrash Ping Derived Datasets\ncrash_aggregates\n\n\nAppendix\nMobile Metrics\n\n\n\n\nRaw Pings\nWe receive data from our users via pings.\nThere are several types of pings,\neach containing different measurements and sent for different purposes.\nTo review a complete list of ping types and their schemata, see \nthis section of the Mozilla Source Tree Docs.\nBackground and Caveats\nThe large majority of analyses can be completed using only the\nmain ping.\nThis ping includes histograms, scalars, and other performance and diagnostic data.\nFew analyses actually rely directly on the raw ping data.\nInstead, we provide derived datasets which are processed versions of these data,\nmade to be:\n\nEasier and faster to query\nOrganized to make the data easier to analyze\nCleaned of erroneous or misleading data\n\nBefore analyzing raw ping data,\ncheck to make sure there isn't already a derived dataset made for your purpose.\nIf you do need to work with raw ping data, be aware that loading the data can take a while.\nTry to limit the size of your data by controlling the date range, etc.\nAccessing the Data\nYou can access raw ping data from an \nATMO cluster using the \nDataset API.\nRaw ping data are not available in re:dash.\nFurther Reading\nYou can find the complete ping documentation.\nTo augment our data collection, see\nCollecting New Data\nMain Ping Derived Datasets\nThe main ping\ncontains most of the measurements used to track performance and health of Firefox in the wild.\nThis ping includes histograms and scalars.\nThis section describes the derived datasets we provide to make analyzing this data easier.\nlongitudinal\nThe longitudinal dataset is a 1% sample of main ping data\norganized so that each row corresponds to a client_id.\nIf you're not sure which dataset to use for your analysis,\nthis is probably what you want.\nContents\nEach row in the longitudinal dataset represents one client_id,\nwhich is approximately a user.\nEach column represents a field from the main ping.\nMost fields contain arrays of values, with one value for each ping associated with a client_id.\nUsing arrays give you access to the raw data from each ping,\nbut can be difficult to work with from SQL.\nHere's a query showing some sample data\nto help illustrate.\nTake a look at the longitudinal examples if you get stuck.\nBackground and Caveats\nThink of the longitudinal table as wide and short.\nThe dataset contains more columns than main_summary\nand down-samples to 1% of all clients to reduce query computation time and save resources.\nIn summary, the longitudinal table differs from main_summary in two important ways:\n\nThe longitudinal dataset groups all data so that one row represents a client_id\nThe longitudinal dataset samples to 1% of all client_ids\n\nAccessing the Data\nThe longitudinal is available in re:dash,\nthough it can be difficult to work with the array values in SQL.\nTake a look at this example query.\nThe data is stored as a parquet table in S3 at the following address.\nSee this cookbook to get started working with the data\nin Spark.\ns3://telemetry-parquet/longitudinal/\nFurther Reading\nThe technical documentation for the longitudinal dataset is located in the\ntelemetry-batch-view documentation.\nWe also have a set of examples in the longitudinal cookbook\nThe code that generates this dataset is here\nmain_summary\nThe main_summary table is the most direct representation of a main ping\nbut can be difficult to work with due to its size. \nPrefer the longitudinal dataset unless using the sampled data is prohibitive.\nContents\nThe main_summary table contains one row for each ping.\nEach column represents one field from the main ping payload,\nthough only a subset of all main ping fields are included.\nThis dataset does not include histograms.\nBackground and Caveats\nThis table is massive, and due to it's size, it can be difficult to work with.\nYou should avoid querying main_summary from re:dash.\nYour queries will be slow to complete and can impact performance for other users,\nsince re:dash on a shared cluster.\nInstead, we recommend using the longitudinal or cross_sectional dataset where possible.\nIf these datasets do not suffice, consider using Spark on an\nATMO cluster.\nIn the odd case where these queries are necessary,\nmake use of the sample_id field and limit to a short submission date range.\nAccessing the Data\nThe data is stored as a parquet table in S3 at the following address.\nSee this cookbook to get started working with the data in Spark.\ns3://telemetry-parquet/main_summary/v3/\nThough not recommended main_summary is accessible through re:dash. \nHere's an example query.\nYour queries will be slow to complete and can impact performance for other users,\nsince re:dash is on a shared cluster.\nFurther Reading\nThe technical documentation for main_summary is located in the\ntelemetry-batch-view documentation.\nThe code responsible for generating this dataset is \nhere\ncross_sectional\nThe cross_sectional dataset provides descriptive statistics\nfor each client_id in a 1% sample of main ping data.\nThis dataset simplifies the longitudinal table by replacing \nthe longitudinal arrays with summary statistics. \nThis is the most useful dataset for describing our user base.\nContent\nEach row in the cross_sectional dataset represents one client_id,\nwhich is approximately a user.\nEach column is a summary statistic describing the client_id.\nFor example, the longitudinal table has a row called geo_country \nwhich contains an array of country codes.\nFor the same client_id the cross_sectional table \nhas columns called geo_country_mode and geo_country_configs \ncontaining single summary statistics for \nthe modal country and the number of distinct countries in the array.\n\n\n\nclient_id\ngeo_country\ngeo_country_mode\ngeo_country_configs\n\n\n\n\n1\narray\n\"US\"\n1\n\n\n2\narray\n\"DE\"\n2\n\n\n\nBackground and Caveats\nThis table is much easier to work with than the longitudinal dataset because\nyou don't need to work with arrays.\nThis table has a limited number of pre-computed summary statistics\nso you're metric may not be included.\nNote that this dataset is a summary of the longitudinal dataset,\nso it is also a 1% sample of all client_ids.\nAll summary statistics are computed over the last 180 days,\nso this dataset can be insensitive to changes over time.\nAccessing the Data\nThe cross_sectional dataset is available in re:dash.\nHere's an example query.\nThe data is stored as a parquet table in S3 at the following address.\nSee this cookbook to get started working with the data in Spark.\ns3://telemetry-parquet/cross_sectional/v1/\nFurther Reading\nThe cross_sectional dataset is generated by \nthis code.\nTake a look at this query for a schema.\nclient_count\nThe client_count dataset is useful for estimating user counts over a few \npre-defined dimensions.\nContent\nThis dataset includes columns for a dozen factors and an HLL variable.\nThe hll column contains a\nHyperLogLog\nvariable, which is an approximation to the exact count.\nThe factor columns include activity date and the dimensions listed\nhere.\nEach row represents one combinations of the factor columns.\nBackground and Caveats\nIt's important to understand that the hll column is not a standard count.\nThe hll variable avoids double-counting users when aggregating over multiple days.\nThe HyperLogLog variable is a far more efficient way to count distinct elements of a set,\nbut comes with some complexity.\nTo find the cardinality of an HLL use cardinality(cast(hll AS HLL)).\nTo find the union of two HLL's over different dates, use merge(cast(hll AS HLL)).\nThe Firefox ER Reporting Query\nis a good example to review.\nFinally, Roberto has a

Derived Datasets\nThe crash ping\nis captured after the main Firefox process crashes or after a content process crashes,\nwhether or not the crash report is submitted to crash-stats.mozilla.org.\nIt includes non-identifying metadata about the crash.\nThis section describes the derived datasets we provide to make analyzing this data easier.\ncrash_aggregates\nThe crash_aggregates dataset compiles crash statistics over various dimensions for each day.\nRows and Columns\nThere's one column for each of the stratifying dimensions and the crash statistics.\nEach row is a distinct set of dimensions, along with their associated crash stats.\nExample stratifying dimensions include channel and country,\nexample statistics include usage hours and plugin crashes.\nSee the complete documentation\nfor all available dimensions\nand statistics.\nAccessing the Data\nThis dataset is accessible via re:dash.\nThe data is stored as a parquet table in S3 at the following address.\nSee this cookbook to get started working with the data in Spark.\ns3://telemetry-parquet/crash_aggregates/v1/\nFurther Reading\nThe technical documentation for this dataset can be found in the\ntelemetry-batch-view
