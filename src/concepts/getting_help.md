# Getting Help

### Mailing lists

Telemetry-related announcements including new datasets, outages, feature
releases, etc are sent to [`fx-data-dev@mozilla.org`][fx-data-dev], a public
mailing list.
Please subscribe to the [mailing list here][subscribe].

There's also an internal mailing list,
[`fx-data-platform@mozilla.com`][fx-data-platform],
meant for internal data platform team communications.
Please speak to your manager if you believe you should be on the list.

### IRC

The data platform team is available in `#telemetry` on `irc.mozilla.org`.
For pipeline-specific issues, you can also find us in `#datapipeline`.

### Slack

The Mozilla data org is reachable at `#fx-metrics` in the internal Mozilla Slack.
