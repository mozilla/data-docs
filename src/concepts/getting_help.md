### Mailing lists

Telemetry-related announcements including new datasets, outages, feature releases, etc are sent to [`fx-data-dev@mozilla.org`](mailto:fx-data-dev@mozilla.org), a public mailing list. Please subscribe to the [mailing list here](https://mail.mozilla.org/listinfo/fx-data-dev).

There's also an internal mailing list, [`fx-data-platform@mozilla.com`](mailto:fx-data-platform@mozilla.com), meant for internal data platform team communications. Please speak to your manager if you believe you should be on the list.

### IRC

The data platform team is available in `#telemetry` on `irc.mozilla.org`. For pipeline-specific issues, you can also find us in `#datapipeline`

### Slack

The Mozilla data org is reachable at `#fx-metrics` in the internal Mozilla Slack
