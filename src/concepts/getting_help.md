# Getting Help

### Mailing lists

Telemetry-related announcements including new datasets, outages, feature
releases, etc are sent to [`fx-data-dev@mozilla.org`][fx-data-dev], a public
mailing list (follow the link for archives and information on how to subscribe).

There's also an internal mailing list,
[`fx-data-platform@mozilla.com`][fx-data-platform],
meant for internal data platform team communications.
Please speak to your manager if you believe you should be on the list.

### Matrix
