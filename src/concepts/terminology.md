# Terminology

You may want to familiarize yourself with a few terms before you start reading the documentation.

- **Analyst**: Anyone who performs an analysis.
  This is more general than referring to a **data scientist**.
- **Ping**: A message that is sent to Mozilla's telemetry servers. Generally speaking, a ping is received from Firefox and includes information about the browser state, user actions, etc.
  ([more details](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/toolkit/components/telemetry/telemetry/data/common-ping.html)). However, a ping can also be received from other Mozilla products or services
- **Dataset**: A set of data that include ping data, derived datasets, etc. It can also refer to a [BigQuery dataset](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/datasets-intro), which is a container for tables.
- **Derived Dataset**: A processed dataset, such as the `clients_daily` dataset. This is in contrast to a **raw** dataset, which is typically a collection of pings.
- **Metric**: Any quantity that we can calculate using our data and that, to some degree, measures some quantity of interest. See also [standard metrics](../metrics/index.md).
- **Session**: The time period that commences when a Firefox browser starts until the browser shuts down.
- **Subsession**: `Sessions` are split into `subsessions` when a 24-hour threshold is exceeded or an environment change occurs.
  ([more details](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/toolkit/components/telemetry/telemetry/concepts/sessions.html?highlight=subsession))
