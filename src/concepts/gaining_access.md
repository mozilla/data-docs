# Accessing Telemetry data

## Public Data

Aggregated information on the Firefox user population (including hardware, operating system, and other usage characteristics) is available at the [Firefox Public Data Report](https://data.firefox.com/) portal.

In addition, a set of curated datasets are available to the public for research purposes. See the [public data cookbook](../cookbooks/public_data.md) for more information.

## Non-public Data

Access to other Telemetry data is limited to two groups:

1. Mozilla employees and contractors
2. Contributors who have signed a [non-disclosure agreement](https://wiki.mozilla.org/NDA), have a sustained track record of contribution, and have a demonstrated need to access this data

If you are an employee or contractor, you should already have the necessary permissions.

If you are a contributor and want to request access to Mozilla Telemetry data, [file a bug in the operations component](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Data%20Platform%20and%20Tools&component=Operations)
and ask an established Mozilla contributor or employee to vouch for you.
