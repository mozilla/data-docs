Access to Firefox's telemetry data is limited to two groups:

1. Mozilla employees and contractors
2. Contributors who have signed an [NDA](https://wiki.mozilla.org/NDA),
   have a sustained track record of contribution, and have a
   demonstrated need to access this data.

If you are an employee or contractor, you should already have the necessary
permissions.

If you are a contributor and wish to apply for access, please [file a ticket
in the operations
component](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Data%20Platform%20and%20Tools&component=Operations)
and ask an established Mozilla contributor or employee to vouch for you.
