# Getting Started

This document is meant to be a complete guide to using Mozilla Data,
so it can look overwhelming at first.
These readings will **get you up and running quickly**.
After these readings you should be able to produce simple analyses
but you should definitely get your analyses reviewed.

This section is meant to introduce new analysts to our data.
A "new analyst" is an employee
or contributor who is interested in working with Mozilla's data
but is new to our data platform and systems.
They could be technical or non-technical: engineer, product manager, or data scientist.
