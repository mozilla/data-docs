# Getting Started

This document is meant to be a complete guide to using Firefox Data,
so it can look overwhelming at first.
These readings will **get you up and running quickly**
After these readings you should be able to produce simple analyses
but you should definitely get your analyses reviewed.

This section is meant to introduce new analysts to our data.
I consider a "new analyst" to be an employee
who is interested in working with our data
but doesn't have previous experience with our tools/data.
They could be technical or non-technical: engineer, PM, or data scientist.
