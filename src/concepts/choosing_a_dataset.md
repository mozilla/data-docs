# Choosing a Desktop Product Dataset

This document will help you find the best data source for a given analysis. It focuses on *descriptive* datasets and does not cover anything attempting to explain *why* something is observed. This guide will help if you need to answer questions like:

- How many Firefox users are active in Germany?
- How many crashes occur each day?
- How many users have installed a specific add-on?

If you want to know whether a causal link occurs between two events, you can learn more at [tools for experimentation](../tools/experiments.md).
