ADI and DAU are oft-discussed censuses. This chapter discusses their history and definition.

### ADI / Active Daily Installs (blocklist fetches)

ADI, one of Firefox’s oldest client censuses, is computed as the number
of conforming requests to the Firefox
[blocklist](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Blocklisting) endpoint. ADI data is
available since July 13, 2008.

It is not possible to opt-out of the blocklist using the Firefox UI, but
users can disable the update mechanism by changing preference values.

A blocklist is shipped in each release and updated when Firefox notices
that more than 24 hours have elapsed since the last update.

The blocklist request does not contain the telemetry `client_id` or any
other persistent identifiers. Some data about the install are provided
as URI parameters:

  - App ID
  - App version
  - Product name
  - Build ID
  - Build target
  - Locale
  - Update channel
  - OS version
  - Distribution
  - Distribution version
  - Number of pings sent by this client for this version of Firefox
    (stored in the pref `extensions.blocklist.pingCountVersion`)
  - Total ping count (stored in the pref
    `extensions.blocklist.pingCountTotal`)
  - Number of full days since last ping

so subsets of ADI may be queried along these dimensions.

The blocklist is kept up-to-date locally using the `UpdateTimerManager`
facility; the update is scheduled in a [manifest] and performed by
[`Blocklist#notify`][bl_notify].

Upon browser startup, after a delay (30 seconds by default),
`UpdateTimerManager` checks whether any of its scheduled tasks are
ready. At each wakeup, the single most-overdue task is triggered, if one
exists. `UpdateTimerManager` then sleeps at least two minutes or until
the next task is scheduled.

Failures are ignored.

A visualization of real and detrended ADI is available at
[Desktop API Details: Long-term trend and decomposition][adi_graph].
The raw data is available in BigQuery (see an example [ADI query in Redash](https://sql.telemetry.mozilla.org/queries/66481)).

Telemetry only reports whether blocklist checking is enabled or disabled
on the client; there is no data in telemetry about blocklist fetches,
age, or update failures.

### DAU / Daily Active Users

Firefox DAU is currently computed as the number of unique `client_id`s
observed in `main` pings received on a calendar day. The DAU count
excludes users who have [opted out of telemetry][optout].

[optout]: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/share-data-mozilla-help-improve-firefox

Each `main` ping describes a single subsession of browser activity.

When and how a ping is sent depends on the reason the subsession ends:

### Coverage pings

The [coverage ping]
([announcement](https://blog.mozilla.org/data/2018/08/20/effectively-measuring-search-in-firefox/))
is a periodic census intended to estimate telemetry opt-out rates.

We estimate that [93% of release channel
profiles](https://metrics.mozilla.com/~rharter/reports/coverage/index.html)
have telemetry enabled (and are therefore included in DAU).
