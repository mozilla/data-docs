# Documentation Structure

The directory structure is meant to feel comfortable for those
familiar with the data platform:

```
.
|--datasets - contains dataset level documentation
|--tools - contains tool level documentation
|--concepts - contains tutorials meant to introduce a new concept to the reader
|--cookbooks - focused code examples for reference
```

The prose documentation is meant to take the reader from beginner to expert.
To this end, the rendered documentation has an order different from the directory structure:

* Getting Started: Get some simple analysis completed so the user understands
  the amount of work involved / what the product feels like
* Tutorials
  * Data Tutorials: tutorials meant to give the reader a complete understanding
    of a specific dataset. Start with a high level overview, then move on to
    completely document the data including Data source, Sampling, Common Issues,
    and where the reader can find the code.
  * Tools tutorials: Tutorials meant to introduce a single data tool or
    analysis best practice.
* Cookbooks
* Reference material - TBD
