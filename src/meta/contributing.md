# Contributing

Documentation is critical to making a usable data platform.
When surveying our users,
their most common complaint has been our lack of documentation.
It's important that we improve our documentation as often as possible.

## Bug reports

If you see an error in the documentation or want to extend a chapter, please
[file a bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?assigned_to=nobody%40mozilla.org&bug_file_loc=http%3A%2F%2F&bug_ignored=0&bug_severity=normal&bug_status=NEW&cf_fx_iteration=---&cf_fx_points=---&component=Documentation%20and%20Knowledge%20Repo%20%28RTMO%29&contenttypemethod=autodetect&contenttypeselection=text%2Fplain&defined_groups=1&flag_type-4=X&flag_type-607=X&flag_type-800=X&flag_type-803=X&flag_type-916=X&form_name=enter_bug&maketemplate=Remember%20values%20as%20bookmarkable%20template&op_sys=Linux&priority=--&product=Data%20Platform%20and%20Tools&rep_platform=x86_64&target_milestone=---&version=unspecified).

## Getting the Raw Documentation

The documentation is intended to be read as HTML at
[`docs.telemetry.mozilla.org`][dtmo].
However, we store the documentation in raw text files in the
[`firefox-data-docs` repo](https://github.com/mozilla/firefox-data-docs).
To begin contributing to the docs, fork the `firefox-data-docs` repo.

## Building the Documentation

Please [see the README](https://github.com/mozilla/firefox-data-docs/blob/master/README.md#building-the-documentation) in the GitHub repository for up-to-date information on how to build the documentation.

## Adding a new article

Be sure to link to your new article from `SUMMARY.md`, or mdBook will not render the file.

The structure of the repository is outlined in [this article](./structure.md).

This documentation is under active development,
so we may already be working on the documentation you need.
Take a look at
[this bug component](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?product=Data%20Platform%20and%20Tools&component=Documentation%20and%20Knowledge%20Repo%20%28RTMO%29&resolution=---)
to check.

## Style Guide

Articles should be written in Markdown.
mdBook uses the [CommonMark dialect][commonmark].

Limit lines to **100 characters** where possible.
Try to split lines at the end of sentences,
or use [Semantic Line Breaks](http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/).
This makes it easier to reorganize your thoughts later.

This documentation is meant to be read digitally.
Keep in mind that people read digital content much differently than other media.
Specifically, readers are going to skim your writing,
so make it easy to identify important information.

Use **visual markup** like **bold text**, `code blocks`, and section headers.
Avoid long paragraphs.
Short paragraphs that describe one concept each makes finding important information easier.

## Spell checking

Articles should use proper spelling, and pull requests will be automatically checked for spelling
errors.

Technical articles often contain words that are not recognized by common dictionaries, if this
happens you may either put specialized terms in `code blocks`, or you may add an exception to
the `.spelling` file in the code repository.

For things like dataset names or field names, `code blocks` should be preferred. Things like
project names or common technical terms should be added to the `.spelling` file.

The [markdown-spell-check](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-spellcheck) package checks spelling as part of the build process. To run it locally, install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (if not already installed) and run `npm install` at the root of the repository. Then run the `scripts/link_check.sh` script.

You may also remove the `--report` parameter to begin an interactive fixing session. In this
case, it is highly recommended to also add the `--no-suggestions` parameter, which greatly
speeds things up.

## Link checking

Any web links should be valid. A dead link might not be your fault, but you will earn a lot of good karma by fixing a dead link!

The [markdown-link-check](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-link-check) package checks links as part of the build process. Note that dead links do not fail the build: links often go dead for all sorts of reasons, and making it a required check constantly caused otherwise-fine pull requests to appear broken. Still, you should check the status of this check yourself when submitting a pull request: you can do this by looking at the Travis CI status after submitting it.

To run link checking locally, run the installation steps [described for spell checking](#spell-checking) if you haven't already, then run the `scripts/link_check.sh` script.

## Supported Plugins

### Mermaid

You may use [`mermaid.js`](https://mermaidjs.github.io/) diagrams in code blocks:

```
graph LR
  you -->|write|docs
  docs --> profit!
```

Which will be rendered as:

```mermaid
graph LR
  you -->|write|docs
  docs --> profit!
```
