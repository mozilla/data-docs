# Growth and Usage dashboards

The Mozilla Growth & Usage dashboards (GUD) are visualizations of growth metrics in a standard way across Mozillaâ€™s products.

The dashboards have been migrated to Looker from the [previous GUD Dashboard](https://mozilla.github.io/gud/) as part of the Looker onboarding in Mozilla.

## Source
The dashboards and views for growth and usage are based on the `telemetry.active_users_aggregates` table, which contains the dimensions and metrics for desktop and mobile, as calculated from the `clients_last_seen` tables.
