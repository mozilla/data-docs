# Growth and Usage dashboards

The Mozilla Growth & Usage dashboards (GUD) are visualizations of growth metrics in a standard way across Mozillaâ€™s products.

The dashboards have been migrated to Looker from the [previous GUD Dashboard](https://mozilla.github.io/gud/) as part of the Looker onboarding in Mozilla.

## Source
The dashboards and views for growth and usage are based on the active_users_aggregates tables that contain the dimensions and metrics as calculated from the `clients_last_seen` tables both for mobile and desktop.
