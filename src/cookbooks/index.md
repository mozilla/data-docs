# Cookbooks

A Cookbook is a focused tutorial to guide you through a focused task.
For example, a Cookbook could:

* Introduce you to what types of analyses are common for (e.g.) Search or Crash data
* Guide you through an example analysis to demonstrate
  the basic principles behind a new statistical technique
