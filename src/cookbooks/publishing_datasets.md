# Making Datasets Publicly Available

Currently, only datasets and query results that are available in BigQuery and 
defined in the [bigquery-etl][bigquery_etl] repository can be made publicly available. 
See [Scheduling BigQuery Queries in Airflow](../cookbooks/bigquery-airflow.md)
on how to create and schedule datasets. Before data can be published, a data review is
required.

To make query results publicly available, a [`metadata.yaml` file][bigquery_etl_metadata] 
must be added alongside the query in [bigquery-etl][bigquery_etl]. For example:

```yaml
friendly_name: SSL Ratios
description: >-
  Percentages of page loads Firefox users have performed that were 
  conducted over SSL broken down by country.
owners:
  - example@mozilla.com
labels:
  application: firefox
  incremental: true     # incremental queries add data to existing tables
  schedule: daily       # scheduled in Airflow to run daily
  public_json: true
  public_bigquery: true
  review_bug: 1414839   # Bugzilla bug ID of data review
  incremental_export: false  # non-incremental JSON export writes all data to a single location
```

The following options define how data is published:
* `public_json`: data is available through the [public HTTP endpoint][public_data_endpoint]
* `public_bigquery`: data is publicly available on BigQuery
    * tables will get published in the `mozilla-public-data` GCP project which is accessible
    by everyone, also external users
* `incremental_export`: determines how data gets split up
  * `true`: data for each `submission_date` gets exported into separate directories (e.g.
    `files/2020-04-15`, `files/2020-04-16`, ...)
    * `false`: all data gets exported into one `files/` directory
* `incremental`: indicates how data gets updated based on the query and Airflow configuration
    * `true`: data gets incrementally updated
    * `false`: the entire table data gets updated
* `review_bug`: Bugzilla bug number to the data review

Data will get published when the query is executed in Airflow. Metadata of available public
data on Cloud Storage is updated daily through a separate Airflow task. 

More information about accessing public data can be found in
[Accessing Public Data](../cookbooks/public_data.md).
