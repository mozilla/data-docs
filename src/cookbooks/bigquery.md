# Accessing and working with BigQuery

With the transition to [SRF](https://cloud.google.com) in 2019 having been completed, BigQuery has become Mozilla's primary data warehouse and SQL Query engine.

The following topics provide an introduction to working with data that is stored
in [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/):

- [Accessing BigQuery](./bigquery/access.md)
- [Writing BigQuery Queries](./bigquery/querying.md)
- [Optimizing BigQuery Queries](./bigquery/optimization.md)

There is a [cost associated with using BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing) based on operations. The on-demand pricing for queries is based on how much data a query scans. Before using BigQuery, please see [Optimizing BigQuery Queries](./bigquery/optimization.md) above for information on how to understand and minimize costs.
