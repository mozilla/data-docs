# See My Pings

> This technique relies on the AWS ingestion pipeline.
In [BigQuery](bigquery.md), the tables in the `moz-fx-data-shared-prod:telemetry_live` dataset
have only a few minutes of latency, so you can query those tables for pings from your `client_id`
using STMO or the BigQuery console instead of writing an analysis plugin.

So you want to see what you're sending the telemetry pipeline, huh? Well follow these steps and we'll have you reading some JSON in no time.

For a more thorough introduction, see [Creating a Real-Time Analysis Plugin Cookbook](realtime_analysis_plugin.md).

## Steps to Create a Viewing Output

1. Get your `clientId` from whatever product you're using. For desktop, it's available in `about:telemetry`.

2. Go to the CEP site: https://pipeline-cep.prod.mozaws.net/

3. Login/Register using your Google `@mozilla.com` account

4. Click on the "Analysis Plugin Deployment" tab

5. Under "Heka Analysis Plugin Configuration", put the following config:

```
filename = '<your_name>_<product>_pings.lua'
message_matcher = 'Type == "telemetry" && Fields[docType] == "<doctype>" && Fields[clientId] == "<your_client_id>"'
preserve_data = false
ticker_interval = 60
```

Where `<product>` is whatever product you're testing, and `<doctype>` is whatever ping you're testing (e.g. `main`, `core`, `mobile-event`, etc.).

6. Under "Heka Analysis Plugin" put the following. This will, by default, show the most recent 10 pings that match your `clientId` on the specified `docType`.

NOTE: If you are looking at `main`, `saved-session`, or `crash` pings, the submitted data is split out into several pieces. Reading just `Fields[submission]`
will not give you the entire submitted ping contents. You can change that to e.g. `Fields[environment.system]`, `Fields[payload.histograms]`, `Fields[payload.keyedHistograms]`.
To see all of the available fields, [look at a ping in the Matcher tab](../tools/cep_matcher.md).

```
require "string"
require "table"

output = {}
max_len = 10
cur_ind = 1

function process_message()
    output[cur_ind] = read_message("Fields[submission]")
    cur_ind = cur_ind + 1
    if cur_ind > max_len then
        cur_ind = 1
    end
    return 0
end

function timer_event(ns, shutdown)
    local res = table.concat(output, ",")
    add_to_payload("[" .. res .. "]")
    inject_payload("json")
end
```

7. Click "Run Matcher", then "Test Plugin". Check that no errors appear in "Debug Output"

8. Click "Deploy Plugin". Your output will be available at `https://pipeline-cep.prod.mozaws.net/dashboard_output/analysis.<username>_mozilla_com.<your_name>_<product>_pings..json`
