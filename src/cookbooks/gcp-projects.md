# Creating a Prototype Data Project on Google Cloud Platform

If you are working on a more complex project (as opposed to ad-hoc or one-off analysis) which you intend to be run in production at some point, it may be worthwhile provisioning a separate _prototype_ GCP project for it with access to our datasets. From the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), you may then:

- Provision service accounts for querying BigQuery (including our production tables) or accessing other GCP resources from the command-line or inside Docker containers
- Write and query data to private BigQuery tables, without worrying about interfering with what we have in production
- Make Docker images available via the Google Container Registry (see [the cookbook on deploying containers](deploying-containers.md))
- Create [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) buckets for storing temporary data
- Create [Google Compute Instances](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances) for test-running software in the cloud
- Create a temporary Kubernetes cluster for test-running a scheduled job with [telemetry-airflow](https://github.com/mozilla/telemetry-airflow)
- Create static dashboards with protosaur (see [Creating Static Dashboards with Protosaur](./operational/protosaur.md))
- Track the costs for all of the above using the Google Cost Dashboard feature of the GCP console

This has a number of advantages over our traditional approach of creating bulk "sandbox" projects for larger teams:

- Easy to track costs of individual components
- Can self-serve short-lived administrative credentials which exist only for the lifespan of the project.
- Can easily spin down projects and resources which have run their course

Note that these prototype GCP projects are not intended to be used for projects which are already in _production_-- those should be maintained on operations-supported projects, presumably after a development phase. Nor are they meant for ad-hoc analysis or experimentation-- for that, just file a request as outlined in the [Accessing BigQuery](bigquery/access.md#access-request) cookbook.

Each sandbox project has a data engineering contact associated with it: this is the person that will create the project for you. Additionally, they are meant to be a resource you can freely ask for advice on how to query or use GCP, and how to build software that lends itself to productionization. If you are a data engineer, the data engineering contact may be yourself, but you should still follow the procedure below for tracking purposes in any case.

To request the creation of a prototype GCP project, [file a bug] using the provided template.
Not sure if you need a project like this? Don't know who to specify as a Data Engineering contact? Not sure what your project budget might be? [Get in touch with the data platform team](../concepts/getting_help.md).

We are currently [tracking these projects on mana](https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/display/DATA/Active+GCP+Prototype+Projects) (link requires Mozilla LDAP)
