## Workspaces

Workspaces in Bigeye allow multiple teams to collaborate simultaneously, with each team managing and monitoring their own data independently.
Each Bigeye workspace includes its own Catalog, BI tools, and ETL tools, Metrics and issues, Templates and schedules, Collections, Deltas.

We are in the process of setting up user workspaces that will align with our existing data access restrictions.
