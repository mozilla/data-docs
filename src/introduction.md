# Firefox Data Documentation

This documentation helps Mozilla's developers and data scientists analyze and interpret the data gathered
by the Firefox Telemetry system.

At [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org), our data-gathering and data-handling practices are anchored in our
[Data Privacy Principles](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/principles/) and elaborated in the
[Mozilla Privacy Policy](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/). You can learn more about what data Firefox
collects and the choices you can make as a Firefox user in the
[Firefox Privacy Notice](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/firefox/).

## Using this document

This documentation is divided into the following sections:

### [Getting Started](concepts/getting_started.md)

This section provides a **quick introduction** to analyzing telemetry data.
After reading these articles, you will be able to confidently perform analysis
over telemetry data.

### [Standard Metrics](metrics/index.md)

This section provides an overview of standard metrics used at Mozilla. Here you'll
find the definitions and descriptions for each.

### [Cookbooks & Tutorials](cookbooks/index.md)

This section contains tutorials presented in a simple problem/solution format, organized by topic.

### [Data Platform Reference](reference/index.md)

This section contains detailed reference material on the Mozilla data platform, including links to other resources where appropriate.

### [Dataset Reference](datasets/reference.md)

Describes all available data we have from our products.
For each dataset, we include a description of the dataset's purpose,
what data is included, how the data is collected,
and how you can change or augment the dataset.
You do not need to read this section end-to-end.

### [Historical Reference](historical/index.md)

This section contains some documentation of things that used to be part of the Mozilla Data Platform, but are no
longer. You can generally safely ignore this section, it is intended only to answer questions like "what happened to X?".

You can find the [fully-rendered documentation here](https://mozilla.github.io/firefox-data-docs/),
rendered with [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook), and hosted on Github pages.
