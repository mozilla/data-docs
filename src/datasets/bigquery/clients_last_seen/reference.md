    AND days_since_seen = 0
GROUP BY
    submission_date,
    os
HAVING
    count > 10 -- remove outliers
    AND lower(os) NOT LIKE '%windows%'
ORDER BY
    os,
    submission_date DESC
```

#### Compute WAU by Channel for the last week

```sql
SELECT
    submission_date,
    normalized_channel,

    AND days_since_seen < 7
GROUP BY
    submission_date,
    normalized_channel
HAVING
    count > 10 -- remove outliers
ORDER BY
    normalized_channel,
    submission_date DESC
