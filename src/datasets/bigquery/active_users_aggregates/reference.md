# Active Users Aggregates reference

<!-- toc -->

## Introduction

The `active_users_aggregates` is a set of tables designed for analysis of client
activity on a daily, weekly and monthly basis, starting from the submission date
of the first baseline ping received by our servers.

## Background

##### Phase 1

These aggregates were initially designed to support the migration of the GUD
Growth and Usage Dashboard as designed in the [Initial proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qvWO49Lr_Z_WErh3I3058A3B1YuiuURx19K3aTdmejM/edit?usp=sharing).
This resulted in three views that collect data for all browsers:

- `telemetry.active_users_aggregates` for an overall analysis of active users and search metrics.
- `telemetry.active_users_aggregates_device` for analysis of active users based on unique devices where the client is installed.
- `telemetry.active_users_aggregates_attribution` for analysis of active users based on the first attribution reported by each client.

##### Phase 2

As part of the performance and quality improvement efforts and to support the [kpi source of truth proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fxnwHRd6EmtKqzuy8SZpl_6CyQIhsZMCUFUQq6gmvtA/edit#),
the view `telemetry.active_users_aggregates` is now based in two views, for Desktop and Mobile data.
The underlying setup is one table per browser, located in the corresponding BigQuery dataset, e.g. `fenix_derived.active_users_aggregates_v1`.

This new setup has a set of benefits:

- Data can be queried per browser, which reduces the amount of data scanned for lower query cost and improves query response time.
- Browser specific logic and KPIs only require modifying the corresponding table and immediately reflects in the unioned views without further effort.
- Browser specific implementations only require the backfill of the corresponding table, which results in reduced cost and time.

## Datasets

#### Active users aggregates

This aggregates contains the metrics daily, weekly and monthly active users,
new profile and search counts aggregated by product and various
business dimensions: attribution, channel, country, city, date,
device model, distribution id, segment, OS details.

#### Active users aggregates for device

The `active_users_aggregates_device` contains the metrics of
daily, weekly and monthly active users, new profiles and search counts
with additional detail of the OS and device where the client is installed.

The reason to have this aggregate in addition to `active_users_aggregates`
is to improve the query performance for final users, by separating the
device analysis, which makes one of the biggest size columns in the table,
as most devices have unique identifiers.

#### Active users aggregates for attribution

The `active_users_aggregates_attribution` contains the metrics of
daily, weekly and monthly active users, new profiles and search counts
to retrieve the source and context of each client installation and the `cohorts`
behaviour.

It can be used to query the set attribution parameters in the context
of the business core dimensions: country, submission_date, `app_name`
and if the browser is set to default.

The reason to have this aggregate in addition to `active_users_aggregates`
is to improve the query performance for final users, by separating the
analysis of the numerous attribution parameters, which is required with
less regularity than other dimensions and mostly for specific purposes.
E.g. During investigations or for marketing campaigns.

This aggregate retrieves Fenix attribution information from
`fenix.firefox_android_clients`.

## Scheduling

These datasets are scheduled to update daily at `3:30` hours in Airflow DAG
[`bqetl_analytics_aggregations`](https://workflow.telemetry.mozilla.org/home?search=bqetl_analytics_aggregations)

## Code Reference

The query and metadata for unioned views (all browsers) is defined in the `active_users_aggregates_`
sub-folder in bigquery-etl under
[`telemetry_derived`](https://github.com/mozilla/bigquery-etl/tree/main/sql/moz-fx-data-shared-prod/telemetry_derived).

The query and metadata per browser are auto-generated using [sql generators](https://github.com/mozilla/bigquery-etl/tree/main/sql_generators/active_users)
and can be accessed by selecting the generated-sql branch in the bigquery-etl GitHub repository and navigating to the browser's sub-folder.
E.g. [Firefox desktop query](https://github.com/mozilla/bigquery-etl/blob/generated-sql/sql/moz-fx-data-shared-prod/firefox_desktop_derived/active_users_aggregates_v1/query.sql).

## Change control

The underlying tables for each browser aggregate are subject to change-control.

This follows the [Infrastructure Change Control process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TTJi4ht7NuzX6BPG_KTr6omaZg70cEpxe9xlpfnHj9k/edit#heading=h.ttegrcfy18ck) and
implies that any modifications to the corresponding code in GitHub will require the approval of members of the Data Science and Data Engineering teams.
