# Dataset Reference

After completing [Choosing a Dataset](../concepts/choosing_a_dataset.md)
you should have a high level understanding of what questions each dataset is able to answer.
This section contains references that focus on a single dataset each.
Reading this section front to back is not recommended.
Instead, identify a dataset you'd like to understand better and read through
the relevant documentation.
After reading the tutorial, you should know all you need about the dataset.

Each tutorial should include:

* Introduction
  * A short overview of why we built the dataset and what need it's meant to solve
  * What data source the data is collected from,
    and a high level overview of how the data is organized
  * How it is stored and how to access the data
* Reference
  * An example query to give the reader an idea of what the data looks like
    and how it is meant to be used
  * How the data is processed and sampled
  * How frequently it's updated, and how it's scheduled
  * An up-to-date schema for the dataset
  * How to augment or modify the dataset
