## Accessing the Data

The `clients_daily` table is accessible through STMO using the
`Telemetry (BigQuery)` data source.

## Data Reference

### Example Queries

#### Compute Churn for a one-day cohort:

```sql
SELECT
  submission_date,
  approx_count_distinct(client_id) AS cohort_dau
FROM
  telemetry.clients_daily
WHERE
  submission_date > '2017-08-31'
  AND submission_date < '2017-10-01'
  AND profile_creation_date LIKE '2017-09-01%'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```

#### Distribution of pings per client per day:

```sql
SELECT
  normalized_channel,
  CASE
    WHEN pings_aggregated_by_this_row > 50 THEN 50
    ELSE pings_aggregated_by_this_row
  END AS pings_per_day,
  approx_count_distinct(client_id) AS client_count
FROM telemetry.clients_daily
WHERE
  submission_date = '2017-09-01'
  AND normalized_channel <> 'Other'
GROUP BY
  normalized_channel,
  pings_per_day
ORDER BY
  pings_per_day,
  normalized_channel
```
