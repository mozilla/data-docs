# Addons

Addon usage by client, partitioned by day.

This documentation is a work in progress. Work is
being tracked in [bug 1364172](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1364172)

## Data Reference

This dataset contains one or more records for every entry in the main ping table
that contain a non-null value for `client_id`.
Each Addons record contains info for a single addon,
or if the main ping did not contain any active addons,
there will be a row with nulls for all the addon fields
(to identify `client_id`s/records without any addons).

## Scheduling

This dataset is updated daily via the [telemetry-airflow](https://github.com/mozilla/telemetry-airflow) infrastructure.
The job DAG runs every day after the Main Summary data has been generated.
The DAG defined in [`dags/bqetl_addons.py`](https://github.com/mozilla/bigquery-etl/blob/master/dags/bqetl_addons.py)

## Code Reference

This dataset is generated by [BigQuery ETL](https://github.com/mozilla/bigquery-etl/). The query that generates the dataset is [`sql/telemetry_derived/addons_v2/query.sql`](https://github.com/mozilla/bigquery-etl/blob/master/sql/telemetry_derived/addons_v2/query.sql).

You may find the [environment reference](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/toolkit/components/telemetry/telemetry/data/environment.html#addons) in The Firefox Source Documentation helpful for understanding the source data.
