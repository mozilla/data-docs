# Analyzing data from SHIELD studies

This article introduces the datasets that are useful for analyzing studies in Firefox.
After reading this article,
you should understand how to answer questions about
study enrollment,
identify telemetry from clients enrolled in an experiment,
and locate telemetry from add-on studies.

## Table of contents

## Dashboards

[Experimenter] is the place to find lists of live experiments.

## Experiment slugs

Each experiment is associated with a slug,
which is the label used to identify the experiment to Normandy clients.
The slug is also used to identify the experiment in most telemetry.
The slug for pref-flip experiments is defined in the recipe by a field named `slug`;
the slug for add-on experiments is defined in the recipe by a field named `name`.

You can find the slug associated with an experiment in Experimenter.

## Tables

### `experiments` map (ping tables)

Ping tables and some derived tables include an `experiments` column
which is a mapping from an experiment slug to a struct of information
about the client's state in an experiment in which they are enrolled.

The struct will include the fields `branch` and `enrollment_id`,
the latter of which is a unique identifier computed at the time of enrollment
to allow counting the number of physical clients that enroll,
even in the presence of `client_id` sharing.

You can collect rows from enrolled clients using syntax like:

```sql
SELECT
  ... some fields ...,
  mozfun.map.get_key(experiments, 'some-experiment-slug-12345').branch
FROM
  telemetry.main
WHERE
  mozfun.map.get_key(experiments, 'some-experiment-slug-12345') IS NOT NULL
```

### `experiments` column (some derived tables)

[`main_summary`](batch_view/main_summary/reference.md),
[`clients_daily`](batch_view/clients_daily/reference.md),
and some other tables
include a `experiments` column
which is a mapping from experiment slug to branch.

You can collect rows from enrolled clients using query syntax like:

```sql
SELECT
  ... some fields ...,
  mozfun.map.get_key(experiments, 'some-experiment-slug-12345') AS branch
FROM
  telemetry.clients_daily
WHERE
  mozfun.map.get_key(experiments, 'some-experiment-slug-12345') IS NOT NULL
```

### `events`

The [`events` table](batch_view/events/reference.md) includes
Normandy and Nimbus enrollment and unenrollment events
for all kinds of studies.

Normandy and Nimbus events both have event category `normandy`.
The event value will contain the experiment slug.

The event schema is described
[in the Firefox source tree](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/toolkit/components/normandy/lib/TelemetryEvents.sys.mjs).

The `events` table is updated daily.

### `telemetry.shield_study_addon`

The `telemetry.shield_study_addon` table contains SHIELD telemetry from legacy add-on experiments,
i.e. key-value pairs sent with the
`browser.study.sendTelemetry()` method from the
[SHIELD study add-on utilities](https://github.com/mozilla/shield-studies-addon-utils/)
library.

The `study_name` attribute of the `payload` column will contain the identifier
registered with the SHIELD add-on utilities.
This is set by the add-on; sometimes it takes the value of
`applications.gecko.id` from the add-on's `manifest.json`.
This is often not the same as the Normandy slug.

The schema for shield-study-addon pings is described in the
[`mozilla-pipeline-schemas` repository](https://github.com/mozilla-services/mozilla-pipeline-schemas/tree/master/schemas/telemetry/shield-study-addon).

The key-value pairs are present in `data` attribute of the `payload` column.

The `telemetry.shield_study_addon` table contains only full days of data.
If you need access to data with lower latency, you can use the "live" table
`telemetry_live.shield_study_addon_v4` which should have latency significantly
less than 1 hour.

### `telemetry.shield_study`

The `telemetry.shield_study` dataset includes
enrollment and unenrollment events for legacy add-on experiments only,
sent by the [SHIELD study add-on utilities](https://github.com/mozilla/shield-studies-addon-utils/).

The `study_name` attribute of the `payload` column will contain the identifier
registered with the SHIELD add-on utilities.
This is set by the add-on; sometimes it takes the value of
`applications.gecko.id` from the add-on's `manifest.json`.
This is often not the same as the Normandy slug.

Normandy also emits its own enrollment and unenrollment events for these studies,
which are available in the `events` table.

The `telemetry.shield_study` table contains only full days of data.
If you need access to data with lower latency, you can use the "live" table
`telemetry_live.shield_study_v4` which should have latency significantly
less than 1 hour.
