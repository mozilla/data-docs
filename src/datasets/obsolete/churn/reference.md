# Data Reference
## Example Queries

This section walks through a typical query to generate data suitable for
visualization.

| field | type | description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `cohort_date` | common, attribute |  The start date bucket of the cohort. This is week the client was acquired.
| `elapsed_periods` | common, attribute | The number of periods that have elapsed since the cohort date. In this dataset, the retention period is 7 days.
| `channel` | attribute | Part of the release train model. An attribute that distinguishes cohorts.
| `geo` | filter attribute | Country code. Used to filter out all countries other than the 'US'
| `n_profiles` | metric | Count of users in a cohort. Use sum to aggregate.

First the fields are extracted and aliased for consistency. `cohort_date` and
`elapsed_periods` are common to most retention queries and are useful concepts
for building on other datasets.

```sql
WITH extracted AS (
    SELECT acquisition_period AS cohort_date,
           current_week AS elapsed_periods,
           n_profiles,
           channel,
           geo
    FROM churn
),
```

The extracted table is filtered down to the attributes of interest. The cohorts
of interest originate in the US and are in the release or beta channels. Note
that `channel` here is the concatenation of the normalized channel and the
funnelcake id. Only cohorts appearing after August 6, 2017 are chosen to be in
this population.

```sql
 population AS (
    SELECT channel,
           cohort_date,
           elapsed_periods,
           n_profiles
    FROM extracted
    WHERE geo = 'US'
      AND channel IN ('release', 'beta')
      AND cohort_date > '20170806'
      -- filter out noise from clients with incorrect dates
      AND elapsed_periods >= 0
      AND elapsed_periods < 12
),
```

The number of profiles is aggregated by the cohort dimensions. The cohort
acquisition date and elapsed periods since acquisition are fundamental to cohort
analysis.

```sql
 cohorts AS (
     SELECT channel,
            cohort_date,
            elapsed_periods,
            sum(n_profiles) AS n_profiles
     FROM population
     GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
),
```
The table will have the following structure. The table is sorted by the first three columns for demonstration.

| `channel` | `cohort_date` | `elapsed_periods` | `n_profiles` |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|--------------|
| release | 20170101 | 0 | 100 |
| release | 20170101 | 1 | 90 |
| release | 20170101 | 2 | 80 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| beta | 20170128 | 10 | 25 |

Finally, retention is calculated through the number of profiles at the time of
the `elapsed_period` relative to the initial period. This data can be imported
into a pivot table for further analysis.

```sql
results AS (
    SELECT c.*,
           iv.n_profiles AS total_n_profiles,
           (0.0+c.n_profiles)*100/iv.n_profiles AS percentage_n_profiles
    FROM cohorts c
    JOIN (
        SELECT *
        FROM cohorts
        WHERE elapsed_periods = 0
    ) iv ON (
        c.cohort_date = iv.cohort_date
        AND c.channel = iv.channel
    )
)
```

| `channel` | `cohort_date` | `elapsed_periods` | `n_profiles` | `total_n_profiles` | `percentage_n_profiles` |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|--------------|--------------------|-------------------------|
| release   | 20170101      | 0                 | 100          | 100                | 1.0                     |
| release   | 20170101      | 1                 | 90           | 100                | 0.9                     |
| release   | 20170101      | 2                 | 80           | 100                | 0.8                     |
| ...       | ....          | ...               | ...          | ...                | ...                     |
| beta      | 20170128      | 10                | 25           | 50                 | 0.5                     |

Obtain the results.

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM results
```

You may consider visualizing using cohort graphs, line charts, or a pivot
tables. See [Firefox Telemetry Retention: Dataset Example Usage](https://sql.telemetry.mozilla.org/dashboard/firefox-telemetry-retention-dataset-example-usage)
for more examples.

## Scheduling
