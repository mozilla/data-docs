Getting a large number of different crash measures across many platforms and channels
([view on Re:dash](https://sql.telemetry.mozilla.org/queries/4769/source)):

```sql
SELECT window_start,
       build_id,
       channel,
       os_name,
       version,
       sum(usage_hours) AS usage_hours,
       sum(main_crashes) AS main,
       sum(content_crashes) AS content,
       sum(gpu_crashes) AS gpu,
       sum(plugin_crashes) AS plugin,
       sum(gmplugin_crashes) AS gmplugin
FROM error_aggregates_v2
  WHERE application = 'Firefox'
  AND (os_name = 'Darwin' or os_name = 'Linux' or os_name = 'Windows_NT')
  AND (channel = 'beta' or channel = 'release' or channel = 'nightly' or channel = 'esr')
  AND build_id > '201801'
  AND window_start > current_timestamp - (1 * interval '24' hour)
  AND experiment_id IS NULL
  AND experiment_branch IS NULL
GROUP BY window_start, channel, build_id, version, os_name
```


Get the number of `main_crashes` on Windows over a small interval
([view on Re:dash](https://sql.telemetry.mozilla.org/queries/51677)):

```sql
SELECT window_start as time, sum(main_crashes) AS main_crashes
FROM error_aggregates_v2
  WHERE application = 'Firefox'
  AND os_name = 'Windows_NT'
  AND channel = 'release'
  AND version = '58.0.2'
  AND window_start > timestamp '2018-02-21'
  AND window_end < timestamp '2018-02-22'
  AND experiment_id IS NULL
  AND experiment_branch IS NULL
GROUP BY window_start
```

## Sampling

### Data sources

The aggregates in this data source are derived from main, crash and core [pings](../../pings.md):
* crash pings are used to count/gather main and content crash events, all other errors from desktop clients (including all other crashes) are gathered from main pings
* core pings are used to count usage hours, first subsession and unique client counts.

## Scheduling

The `error_aggregates` job is run continuously, using the Spark Streaming infrastructure

## Schema

The `error_aggregates_v2` table has the following columns which define its dimensions:

* `window_start`: beginning of interval when this sample was taken
* `window_end`: end of interval when this sample was taken (will always be 5 minutes more
  than `window_start` for any given row)
* `submission_date_s3`: the date pings were submitted for a particular aggregate
* `channel`: the channel, like `release` or `beta`
* `version`: the version e.g. `57.0.1`
* `display_version`: like version, but includes beta number if applicable e.g. `57.0.1b4`
* `build_id`: the `YYYYMMDDhhmmss` timestamp the program was built, like `20160123180541`. This is also known as the `build ID` or `buildid`
* `application`: application name (e.g. `Firefox` or `Fennec`)
* `os_name`: name of the OS (e.g. `Darwin` or `Windows_NT`)
* `os_version`: version of the OS
* `architecture`: build architecture, e.g. `x86`
* `country`: country code for the user (determined using geoIP), like `US` or `UK`
* `experiment_id`: identifier of the experiment being participated in, such as `e10s-beta46-noapz@experiments.mozilla.org`, null if no experiment or for unpacked rows (see [Experiment unpacking](#experiment-unpacking))
* `experiment_branch`: the branch of the experiment being participated in, such as `control` or `experiment`, null if no experiment or for unpacked rows (see [Experiment unpacking](#experiment-unpacking))

And these are the various measures we are counting:

* `usage_hours`: number of usage hours (i.e. total number of session hours reported by the pings in this aggregate, note that this might include time where
  people are not actively using the browser or their computer is asleep)
* `count`: number of pings processed in this aggregate
* `main_crashes`: number of main process crashes (or just program crashes, in the non-e10s case)
* `startup_crashes` : number of startup crashes
* `content_crashes`: number of content process crashes (`version => 58` only)
* `gpu_crashes`: number of GPU process crashes
* `plugin_crashes`: number of plugin process crashes
* `gmplugin_crashes`: number of Gecko media plugin (often abbreviated `GMPlugin`) process crashes
* `content_shutdown_crashes`: number of content process crashes that were caused by failure to shut down in a timely manner (`version => 58` only) 
* `browser_shim_usage_blocked`: number of times a CPOW shim was blocked from being created by browser code
* `permissions_sql_corrupted`: number of times the permissions SQL error occurred (beta/nightly only)
* `defective_permissions_sql_removed`: number of times there was a removal of defective `permissions.sqlite` (beta/nightly only)
* `slow_script_notice_count`: number of times the slow script notice count was shown (beta/nightly only)
* `slow_script_page_count`: number of pages that trigger slow script notices (beta/nightly only)
