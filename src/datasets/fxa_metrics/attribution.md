# Attribution of Firefox Accounts

## Introduction

Users can create or login to an account through an increasingly large number of relying services and entrypoints. This article describes how we attribute authentications to their point of origin, and documents some of the most frequently trafficked entrypoints (it would not be feasible to list them all, but we will try to update this document when there are substantial changes).

## Types of Attribution

We can attribute accounts to the **service** that they sign up for, as well as the **entrypoint** that they use to begin the authentication flow. Each service typically has many entrypoints; sync, for example, has web-based entrypoints and browser-based entrypoints (see below).

### Service Attribution

There is a variable called `service` that we use to (1) attribute users to the relying services of FxA that they have authenticated with and (2) attribute individual events to the services they are associated with. **Except in the case of sync**, `service` is a mapping from the oauth `client_id` of the relying service/product to a human readable string. Note that this mapping is currently maintained by hand, and is done after the events have been logged by the server. Currently, mapping to the human-readable `service` variable is only done for amplitude metrics, where it is treated as a user property. There is also a `service` variable in the `activity_events` and `flow_metadata` STMO tables (FxA Activity Metrics data source), however it only contains the opaque oauth `client_id`, not the human-readable string. A table of some of the most common oauth `client_id`s along with their corresponding `service` mapping is shown below. This is not a complete list.

In amplitude, there is also a `fxa_services_used` user property which maintains an array of all the services a user has authenticated with.

Some amplitude charts segmenting by service can be found [here](https://analytics.amplitude.com/mozilla-corp/notebook/detelo9).

### Funnel Attribution (entrypoint and utm parameters)

We can also attribute users to where they began the authentication process, be it from a website or an application. Attribution is done through query parameters appended to links that point at `accounts.firefox.com` (which hosts the actual authentication process). These parameters are logged along with with any metrics events that the user generates during the authentication flow. The table below lists the query parameters that are currently in use, along with the values associated with some of the most common funnels. Note that only `entrypoint` is typically logged for flows beginning within the browser. Web-based entrypoints are listed first, followed by entrypoints that are found within the browser chrome itself.

See the [Metrics for Relying Parties](https://mozilla.github.io/ecosystem-platform/docs/relying-parties/metrics-for-relying-parties) documentation for more implementational detail on utm/entrypoint parameters.

Important notes: **(1)** Users who are signed into a Firefox account have a different experience than those that are signed out. Signed-in users typically see a promotion of FxA-relying services, while signed-out users see a Call to Action to create an account. **(2)** The attribution parameters for this page were standardized starting on version 66. **Previous values for entrypoint** include `whatsnew` and `mozilla.org-wnp64` - these values should be used when doing historical analysis of versions prior to 66. |
