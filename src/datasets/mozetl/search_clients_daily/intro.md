`search_clients_daily` is designed to enable client-level search analyses.
Querying this dataset can be slow;
consider using `search_aggregates` for coarse analyses.

#### Contents

`search_clients_daily` has one row for each unique combination of:
(`client_id`, `submission_date`, `engine`, `source`).

In addition to the standard search count aggregations,
this dataset includes some descriptive data for each client.
For example, we include `country` and `channel` for each row of data.
In the event that a client sends multiple pings on a given `submission_date`
we choose an arbitrary value from the pings for that (`client_id`, `submission_date`),
unless otherwise noted.

There are five standard search count aggregation columns:
`sap`, `tagged-sap`, and `tagged-follow-on`, `organic` and `unknown`.
Note that, if there were no such searches in a row's segment
(i.e. the count would be 0),
the column value is `null`.
Each of these columns represent different types of searches.
For more details, see the [search data documentation]

#### Background and Caveats

`search_clients_daily` does not include
(`client_id` `submission_date`) pairs
if we did not receive a ping for that `submission_date`.

We impute a `NULL` `engine` and `source` for pings with no search counts.
This ensures users who never search are included in this dataset.

This dataset is large.
Consider using an [ATMO Spark cluster](../../../tools/spark.md) for heavy analyses.
If you're querying this dataset from re:dash,
heavily limit the data you read using `submission_date_s3` or `sample_id`.
