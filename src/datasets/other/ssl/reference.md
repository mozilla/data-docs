## Combining Rows

This is a dataset of ratios. You can't combine ratios if they have different bases. For example,
if 50% of 10 loads (5 loads) were SSL and 5% of 20 loads (1 load) were SSL, you cannot calculate
that 20% (6 loads) of the total loads (30 loads) were SSL unless you know that the 50% was for
10 and the 5% was for 20.

If you're reluctant, for product reasons, to share the numbers 10 and 20, this gets tricky.

So what we've done is normalize the whole batch of 30 down to 1. That means we tell you that
50% of one-third of the loads (0.333...) was SSL and 5% of the other two-thirds of the loads
(0.666...) was SSL. Then you can figure out the overall 20% figure by this calculation:

`0.5 * 0.333 + 0.05 * 0.666 = 0.2`

For this dataset the same rule applies. To combine rows' ratios (to, for example, see what the
SSL ratio was across all `os` and `country` for a given `submission_date`), you must first
multiply them by the rows' `normalized_pageviews` values.

Or, in JavaScript:

```js
let rows = query_result.data.rows;
let ratioForDateInQuestion = rows
  .filter(row => row.submission_date == dateInQuestion)
  .reduce((row, acc) => acc + row.normalized_pageloads * row.ratio, 0);
```

## Schema

The data is output in re:dash API format:
