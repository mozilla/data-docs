Introduction
------------

[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)
is a data processing engine designed to be fast and easy to use.
We have setup
[Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)
that use Spark to analyze our Telemetry data.
Jupyter notebooks can be easily shared and updated among colleagues,
and, when combined with Spark, enable richer analysis than SQL alone.

The Spark clusters can be launched from [ATMO](https://analysis.telemetry.mozilla.org).
The Spark Python API is called PySpark.

Setting Up a Spark Cluster On ATMO
----------------------------------

1.  Go to <https://analysis.telemetry.mozilla.org>
2.  Click “Launch an ad-hoc Spark cluster”.
3.  Enter some details:
    1.  The “Cluster Name” field should be a short descriptive name,
        like “chromehangs analysis”.
    2.  Set the number of workers for the cluster. Please keep in mind
        to use resources sparingly; use a single worker to write and
        debug your job.
    3.  Upload your SSH public key.
4.  Click “Submit”.
5.  A cluster will be launched on AWS pre-configured with Spark, Jupyter
    and some handy data analysis libraries like `pandas` and `matplotlib`.

Once the cluster is ready, you can tunnel Jupyter through SSH by
following the instructions on the dashboard.
For example:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa -L 8888:localhost:8888 hadoop@ec2-54-70-129-221.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
```

Finally, you can launch Jupyter in Firefox by visiting http://localhost:8888.

The Python Jupyter Notebook
---------------------------

When you access http://localhost:8888, two example Jupyter notebooks
are available to peruse.

Starting out, we recommend looking through the
[Telemetry Hello World](https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla-reports/blob/master/tutorials/telemetry_hello_world.kp/orig_src/Telemetry%20Hello%20World.ipynb)
notebook.
It gives a nice overview of Jupyter and analyzing telemetry data using PySpark and the RDD API.

### Using Jupyter

Jupyter Notebooks contain a series of cells.
Each cell contains code or markdown.
To switch between the two, use the drop-down at the top.
To run a cell, use shift-enter;
this either compiles the markdown or runs the code.
To create new cell, select Insert -> Insert Cell Below.

A cell can output text or plots.
To output plots inlined with the cell,
run `%pylab inline`, usually below your import statements:

The notebook is setup to work with Spark. See the "Using Spark" section
for more information.

### Schedule a periodic job

Scheduled Spark jobs allow a Jupyter notebook to be updated consistently,
making a nice and easy-to-use dashboard.

To schedule a Spark job:

1.  Visit the analysis provisioning dashboard at
    <https://analysis.telemetry.mozilla.org> and sign in
2.  Click “Schedule a Spark Job”
3.  Enter some details:
    1.  The “Job Name” field should be a short descriptive name, like
        “chromehangs analysis”.
    2.  Upload your Jupyter notebook containing the analysis.
    3.  Set the number of workers of the cluster in the “Cluster Size”
        field.
    4.  Set a schedule frequency using the remaining fields.

Now, the notebook will be updated automatically and the results can be
easily shared. Furthermore, all files stored in the notebook's local
working directory at the end of the job will be automatically uploaded
to S3, which comes in handy for simple ETL workloads for example.

For reference, see
[Simple Dashboard with Scheduled Spark Jobs and Plotly](https://robertovitillo.com/2015/03/13/simple-dashboards-with-scheduled-spark-jobs-and-plotly).

### Sharing a Notebook

Jupyter notebooks can be shared in a few different ways.

#### Sharing a Static Notebook

An easy way to share is using a gist on Github.

1.  Download file as `.ipynb`
2.  Upload to a gist on [`gist.github.com`](https://gist.github.com)
3.  Enter the gist URL at [Jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)
4.  Share with your colleagues!

#### Sharing a Scheduled Notebook

Setup your scheduled notebook. After it's run, do the following:

1.  Go to the "Schedule a Spark job" tab in ATMO
2.  Get the URL for the notebook (under 'Currently Scheduled Jobs')
3.  Paste that URL into [Jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)

Zeppelin Notebooks
------------------

We also have support for [Apache Zeppelin](https://zeppelin.apache.org/)
notebooks. The notebook server for that is running on port 8890, so you
can connect to it just by tunnelling the port (instead of port 8888 for
Jupyter). For example:

```
ssh -i \~/.ssh/id\_rsa -L 8890:localhost:8890
hadoop@ec2-54-70-129-221.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
```


Using Spark
-----------

Spark is a general-purpose cluster computing system - it allows users to
run general execution graphs. APIs are available in Python, Scala, and
Java. The Jupyter notebook utilizes the Python API. In a nutshell, it
provides a way to run functional code (e.g. map, reduce, etc.) on large,
distributed data.

Check out
[Spark Best Practices](https://robertovitillo.com/2015/06/30/spark-best-practices/)
for tips on using Spark to its full capabilities.

### `SparkContext` (`sc`)

Access to the Spark API is provided through `SparkContext`. In the Jupyter
notebook, this is the `sc` object. For example, to create a
distributed RDD of monotonically increasing numbers 1-1000:

```python
numbers = range(1000)
# no need to initialize sc in the Jupyter notebook
numsRdd = sc.parallelize(numbers)
nums.take(10) #no guaranteed order
```

### Spark RDD

The Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD) is Spark's basic data structure.
The operations that are performed on these structures are distributed to
the cluster. Only certain actions (such as collect() or take(N)) pull an
RDD in locally.

RDD's are nice because there is no imposed schema - whatever they
contain, they distribute around the cluster. Additionally, RDD's can be
cached in memory, which can greatly improve performance of some
algorithms that need access to data over and over again.

Additionally, RDD operations are all part of a directed, acyclic graph.
This gives increased redundancy, since Spark is always able to recreate
an RDD from the base data (by rerunning the graph), but also provides
lazy evaluation. No computation is performed while an RDD is just being
transformed (a la map), but when an action is taken (e.g. reduce, take)
the entire computation graph is evaluated. Continuing from our previous
example, the following gives some of the peaks of a sin wave:

```python
import numpy as np
#no computation is performed on the following line!
sin_values = numsRdd.map(lambda x : np.float(x) / 10).map(lambda x : (x, np.sin(x)))
#now the entire computation graph is evaluated
sin_values.takeOrdered(5, lambda x : -x[1])
```

For jumping into working with Spark RDD's, we recommend reading the
[Spark Programming Guide](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/programming-guide.html).

### Spark SQL and Spark DataFrames/Datasets

Spark also supports traditional SQL, along with special data structures
that require schemas. The Spark SQL API can be accessed with the
`spark` object. For example:

`   longitudinal = spark.sql('SELECT * FROM longitudinal')`

creates a DataFrame that contains all the longitudinal data. A Spark
DataFrame is essentially a distributed table, a la Pandas or R
DataFrames. Under the covers they are an RDD of Row objects, and thus
the entirety of the RDD API is available for DataFrames, as well as a
DataFrame specific API. For example, a SQL-like way to get the count of
a specific OS:

`   longitudinal.select("os").where("os = 'Darwin'").count()`

To Transform the DataFrame object to an RDD, simply do:

`  longitudinal_rdd = longitudinal.rdd`

In general, however, the DataFrames are performance optimized, so it's
worth the effort to learn the DataFrame API.

For more overview, see the
[SQL Programming Guide](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html).
See also the
[Longitudinal Tutorial](https://reports.telemetry.mozilla.org/post/tutorials/longitudinal_dataset.kp),
one of the available example notebooks when you start a cluster.

### Available Data Sources for `SparkSQL`

For information about data sources available for querying (e.g. Longitudinal dataset),
see [Choosing a Dataset](/concepts/choosing_a_dataset.md).

These datasets are optimized for fast access, and will far out-perform
analysis on the raw Telemetry ping data.

### Accessing the Spark UI

After establishing an SSH connection to the Spark cluster, go to https://localhost:8888/spark
to see the Spark UI.
It has information about job statuses and task completion,
and may help you debug your job.

The `MozTelemetry` Library
------------------------

We have provided a library that gives easy access to the raw telemetry ping data.
For example usage, see the
[Telemetry Hello World](https://reports.telemetry.mozilla.org/post/tutorials/telemetry_hello_world.kp)
example notebook.
Detailed documentation for the library can be found at the
[Python MozTelemetry Documentation](https://python-moztelemetry.readthedocs.io).

### Using the Raw Ping Data

First off, import the `moztelemetry` library using the following:

`from moztelemetry.dataset import Dataset`


The ping data is an RDD of JSON elements. For example, using the
following:

```python
pings = Dataset.from_source("telemetry") \
    .where(docType='main') \
    .where(submissionDate="20180101") \
    .where(appUpdateChannel="nightly") \
    .records(sc, sample=0.01)
```

returns an RDD of 1/100th of Firefox Nightly JSON pings submitted on
from January 1 2018. Now, because it's JSON, pings are easy to access.
For example, to get the count of each OS type:

```python
os_names = pings.map(lambda x: (x['environment']['system']['os']['name'], 1))
os_counts = os_names.reduceByKey(lambda x, y: x + y)
os_counts.collect()
```

Alternatively, `moztelemetry` provides the `get_pings_properties`
function, which will gather the data for you:

```python
from moztelemetry import get_pings_properties
subset = get_pings_properties(pings, ["environment/system/os/name"])
subset.map(lambda x: (x["environment/system/os/name"], 1)).reduceByKey(lambda x, y: x + y).collect()
```

FAQ

Please add more FAQ as questions are answered by you or for you.

### How can I load parquet datasets in a Jupyter notebook?

Use `spark.read.parquet`, e.g.:

```python
dataset = spark.read.parquet("s3://the_bucket/the_prefix/the_version")`
```

For more information see [Working with Parquet](/cookbooks/parquet.md).

### I got a REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED! error

AWS recycles hostnames, so this warning is expected.
Removing the offending key from `$HOME/.ssh/known_hosts` will remove the warning.
You can find the line to remove by finding the line in the output that says

`Offending key in /path/to/hosts/known_hosts:2`

Where 2 is the line number of the key that can be deleted.
Just remove that line, save the file, and try again.

### Why is my notebook hanging?

There are a few common causes for this:

1. Currently, our Spark notebooks can only run a single Python kernel at
   a time. If you open multiple notebooks on the same cluster and try to
   run both, the second notebook will hang. Be sure to close notebooks
   using "Close and Halt" under the "File" drop-down.
2. The connection from PySpark to the Spark driver might be lost.
   Unfortunately the best way to recover from this for the moment seems to
   be spinning up a new cluster.
3. Cancelling execution of a notebook cell doesn't cancel any spark jobs
   that might be running in the background. If your spark commands seem to
   be hanging, try running \`sc.cancelAllJobs()\`.

### How can I keep running after closing the notebook?

For long-running computation, it might be nice to close the notebook
(and the SSH session) and look at the results later.
Unfortunately, **all cell output will be lost when a notebook is closed**
(for the running cell).
To alleviate this, there are a few options:

1. Have everything output to a variable. These values should still be
   available when you reconnect.
2. Put %%capture at the beginning of the cell to store all output.
   [See the documentation](https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/interactive/magics.html#cellmagic-capture).

### How do I load an external library into the cluster?

Assuming you've got a URL for the repo, you can create an egg for it
this way:

```python
!git clone `<repo url>` && cd `<repo-name>` && python setup.py bdist_egg`\
sc.addPyFile('`<repo-name>`/dist/my-egg-file.egg')`
```

Alternately, you could just create that egg locally, upload it to a web
server, then download and install it:

```python
import requests`\
r = requests.get('`<url-to-my-egg-file>`')`\
with open('mylibrary.egg', 'wb') as f:`\
  f.write(r.content)`\
sc.addPyFile('mylibrary.egg')`
```

You will want to do this **before** you load the library. If the library
is already loaded, restart the kernel in the Jupyter notebook.
