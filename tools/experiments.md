# Guide to our Experimental Tools

## Shield
* Shield is an addon-based experimentation platform with fine-tuned enrollment criteria. The system add-on landed in FF 53.
* For the moment, it sends back data in its own `shield` type ping, so there's lots of flexibility in data you can collect.
* Uses the Normandy server to serve out study “recipes” (?)
* Annotates the main ping in the environment/experiments block
* The shield system is itself a system add-on, so rolling out changes to the entire system does not require riding release trains
* Strategy and Insights (strategyandinsights@mozilla.com) team are product owners and shepherd the study development and release process along
* Opt-out experiments should be available soon?

    * When should you use SHIELD over other options?
