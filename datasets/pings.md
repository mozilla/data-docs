# Data Reference

You can find the reference documentation for all ping types
[here](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/toolkit/components/telemetry/telemetry/concepts/pings.html).

# Ping Metadata

The telemetry data pipeline appends a `meta` key to the ping body containing
information about the ingestion environment, including timestamps;
geo-IP data about the client;
and fields extracted from the ping or client headers that are useful for downstream processing.

Since the `meta` key is not present in the ping as it is sent by the client,
these fields are documented here.

As of September 28, 2018, members of the `meta` key on main pings include:


Key | Description
--- | -----------
appBuildId |
appName | e.g. "Firefox"
appUpdateChannel |
appVendor | e.g. "Mozilla"
appVersion |
clientId |
creationTimestamp | Client `creationDate` field, transformed to nanoseconds since epoch
Date | Client HTTP header reflecting the client time when the ping is sent, like `Fri, 28 Sep 2018 14:01:57 GMT`
DNT | Not present in all pings
docType | e.g. "main"
documentId | A UUID identifying the ping, generated by the client
geoCity | from Geo-IP lookup of client IP; `??` if unknown
geoCountry | from Geo-IP lookup of client IP; `??` if unknown
geoSubdivision1 | from Geo-IP lookup of client IP; not present in all pings
geoSubdivision2 | from Geo-IP lookup of client IP; not present in all pings
Host | Public hostname of the ingestion endpoint
Hostname | Private hostname of the ingestion endpoint
normalizedChannel |
normalizedOSVersion |
os |
reason | Documented [in the source tree](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/toolkit/components/telemetry/telemetry/data/main-ping.html)
sampleId | `crc32(clientId) % 100`
sourceName | e.g. "telemetry"
sourceVersion | Client `version` field (reflecting the version of the ping format)
submissionDate | Server date (GMT) when ping was received, like `20180928`
telemetryEnabled | Extracted value of `environment.settings.telemetryEnabled`, describing whether opt-in telemetry is enabled
Timestamp | Server timestamp when the ping is received, expressed as nanoseconds since epoch
Type | e.g. "telemetry"
X-PingSender-Version | Not present in all pings
