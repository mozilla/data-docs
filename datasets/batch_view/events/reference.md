# Data Reference

## Example Queries

This is a work in progress.
The work is being tracked
[here](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1364170).

## Sampling

The events dataset contains one row for each event in a main ping.
This dataset is derived from [`main_summary`](../main_summary/reference.md)
so any of `main_summary`'s filters affect this dataset as well.

Data is currently available from 2017-01-05 on.

## Scheduling

The events dataset is updated daily, shortly after
[`main_summary`](../main_summary/reference.md) is updated.
The job is scheduled on [Airflow](https://github.com/mozilla/telemetry-airflow).
The DAG is [here](https://github.com/mozilla/telemetry-airflow/blob/master/dags/main_summary.py#L63).

## Firefox events

Firefox has an API to record events, which are then submitted through the main ping.
The format and mechanism of event collection in Firefox is documented [here](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/toolkit/components/telemetry/telemetry/collection/events.html).

The full events data pipeline is [documented here](/concepts/pipeline/event_pipeline.md).

## Schema

As of 2017-01-26, the current version of the `events` dataset is `v1`, and has a schema as follows:
