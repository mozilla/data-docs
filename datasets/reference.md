Each tutorial should include:

  * What data source the data is collected from,
    and a high level overview of how the data is organized
  * How it is stored and how to access the data including
    * whether the data is available in re:dash
    * S3 paths
* Reference
  * An example query to give the reader an idea of what the data looks like
    and how it is meant to be used
  * How the data is processed and sampled
  * How frequently it's updated, and how it's scheduled
  * An up-to-date schema for the dataset
