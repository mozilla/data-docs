# Collecting New Data

## Guidelines

For information about what sorts of data may be collected,
and for information on getting a data collection request reviewed,
please read the [Data Collection Guidelines.][data_collection]

## Mechanics

The mechanics of how to instrument new data collection in Firefox are covered in
[Adding a new Telemetry probe](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/toolkit/components/telemetry/telemetry/start/adding-a-new-probe.html).

For non-Telemetry data collection, we have a mechanism for streamlining
ingestion of structured (JSON) data that utilizes the same underlying
infrastructure. See [this cookbook](/cookbooks/new_ping.md) for details on using it.
