= Datasets and Data Collection

After completing link:/concepts/choosing_a_dataset.md[Choosing A Dataset], 
you should have a high level understanding of what questions each dataset is able to answer.
This section contains a series of tutorials which will help you understand our dataset more deeply.

Reading this section front to back is not recommended.
Instead, identify a dataset you'd like to understand better and read through 
the relevant documentation.


// Uses to consider in this section:
// * Analyst looking for information on a given dataset (how is l10l sampled?)
// * Engineer, we have a question, does this data exist? What does it look like?
// * New hire, do we collect data?
